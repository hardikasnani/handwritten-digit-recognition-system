# handwritten-digit-recognition-system
I implemented a CNN to train and test a handwritten digit recognition system using the MNIST dataset. I also read the paper “Backpropagation Applied to Handwritten Zip Code Recognition” by LeCun et al. 1989 for more details, but my architecture does not mirror everything mentioned in the paper. I also carried out a few experiments such as adding different dropout rates, using batch normalization, and using different optimizers in the baseline model. Finally, I discuss the impact of experiments on the learning curves and testing performance.
